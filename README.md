## How to run it

The server that this app relies on can be executed from Main in the server package, 
and the client executable is the Main in the client package.

## How to contribute to it

This is a private project done only by my team initially, and after the course completion 
you are not really meant to contribute it. I chose to copy the repo to GitHub and continue development
for my own sake, and hence I do not really accept contributions.
