### **Contribution check**
We see that we are all on track on our contributions to the project

13:55

### **All tasks we need to finish**
We go over the main thing we need to do: Drag and Drop.

We want to try to implement advanced features, but they have to be in order.

We also need to implement a couple more tests in the backend since we have added websockets and long polling.

We also should clean the code and add comments, so it's easier to read.

We also should add more issues on the first merges we made to the project.

We are missing 1600 more words in the heuristics report.
We need the four corners graph for the heuristics.

Review Ana's feedback for the product pitch.
Might need to use Zoom to film the video.

We decide to finish the code either on Sunday or Monday so that we have some time for the rest of the work we need.

The interview we will have some questions about relations and also technical questions which everyone should know.
