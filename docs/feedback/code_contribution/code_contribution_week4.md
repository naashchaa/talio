# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Good

Feedback: Top: - The repository has a good amount of commits for now.
	- Commits aggregate a coherent change to the system.
Tip: - Please try to follow the sentence "This commit will" + the commit message for your commit messages. 
	- Commits should only affect a small number of files.

#### Isolation

Grade: Good

Feedback: Top: - Overall, it appears that the team is following a good development process.
Tip: - Make sure that you use feature branches/mr to isolate individual features.


#### Reviewability

Grade: Good

Feedback: Top: - The MRs consistently have a clear focus that can be easily determined from the title and description, making them easy to understand and review.
Tip: - You can close issues directly from the MR by writing "Closes #" and the number of the issue.
	- You can improve the ease of reviewing by ensuring that each commit within the MR is also well-organized and focused.
	-  This will make it even easier for reviewers to understand the individual changes and their impact on the codebase.

#### Code Reviews

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: Top: - I've seen that you started leaving reviews.
	- I like that you are open to take the feedback and use it to make meaningful changes.
Tip: - Leaving more reviews would likely enhance the collaborative process and lead to even greater improvements in code quality.
	- Only "Looks good" is not valid review.
	- Provide more feedback.
	- Comments in the MRs should be constructive and  goal-oriented.


#### Build Server

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: Top: - I have seen that you choose the check style rules.
Tip: - Be more careful with the pipeline. Builds fail too frequently.
	-  Please make sure that your pipeline doesn't fail before making the merge request.
