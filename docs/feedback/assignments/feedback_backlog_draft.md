### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog draft was delivered on time.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Your backlog contains stakeholders, terminology and a list of user stories.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The prioritization of stories is good and it is consistent with lecture. Unfortunately there was a misunderstanding regarding Moscow method and epics and you should group your features using Epics not Moscow method.
This should not that you long because the prioritization of stories is good. Please use the slides as a reference of how to group them into epics and the example from last year for the user stories.


### User Stories

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The user stories follow the required format. I also liked that your requirements were written from the user perspective. You can also separate the user into user (which would be the member) and admin instead of saying that "I want to be able to be seaparated into admin or member". All required iteractions are covered.The size of most user story is small and their effect is clear. Please try to make some of them less ambigous. Don't say "I want to have accessibility". State clear what feature you would want to implement (using the user stories). Instead of saying "use and application to organize my tasks" you could say explicitly that I want to have a board to organize my tasks, I want to have a board that has a list of tasks etc. You have to think of this user stories as you would implement that functionality in your application. "To organize my tasks" is more a goal than an actual feature.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: For each user story you should add acceptance criteria (see slides). This is mandatory and you must add this to your backlog.
