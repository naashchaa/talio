#### Reviewability

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: General advice - Don't forget to add a description to your mr, this will help your teammates to review your mr more easily.


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: You should leave comments and reviews for every MR! Also do not and never from now on approve your own mr!! You should have 2 approvals from your teammates. 

#### Build Server

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: You should add in the checkstyle.xml file 10+ checkstyle rules. Also you should be careful to check if your project builds, your tests pass and 
your checkstyle passes (this will prevent pipeline fails).
